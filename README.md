Final Project for CSC 165 - Computer Game Architecture and Implementation: 

This project was primarily coded in Java and JavaScript. It uses a server-client UDP system to
communicate among different computers.

This is a simple online game where two players
can face one-on-one as two space pirate cats to gain more loot than the other. Once a player meets the 
max points, they win the game.
